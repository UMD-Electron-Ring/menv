\section{Overview}

MENV can be run from the command line (``clmenv.m") or GUI (``menv.m"). The GUI and original MENV functions were written by Hui Li. Kiersten added the command line functionality, and copied over much of Hui Li's original code into \verb|clmenv|. 

\subsection{GUI MENV}

To access the GUI, call \verb|menv| from the Matlab command line. The dependencies of \verb|menv| are listed below:

\begin{itemized}
\item menv.m :: Contains code for creating main GUI window
\item menv.mat
\item menvEvent.m :: Contains code for interpreting commands sent by the GUI window
\item clmenv.m :: Contains many of the upper level routines, called by some of the commands in menvEvent.m
\end{itemized}

The parameters and settings for the current run are stored in the global object \verb|clm|.
